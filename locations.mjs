const acablasDesc = "<p>The Acablas Ruins are a natural rock formation with an underground cave on the planet Auratera, which, as a vergence in the Force, had been the subject of a tug-of-war between the Jedi and Sith for years. Two structures belonging to both orders of the Force are situated on either side of the vergence, with a funnel-shaped entrance on a high mountain.<br /><br />The existence of the Acablas Ruins has been recorded in ancient archives, holocrons, and diaries of Jedi and Sith curators of the site. The ruins are located exactly between the Erkeere Ridge to the east (Nexus of Power, p. 120) and the Square Sea of Auratera, surrounded by numerous thick-stemmed coniferous forests. The Force effect of the vergence could be felt as far as 20 kilometers away, with people drawn to the ruins. The arduous path to the ruins led directly through the forests, along 40-meter waterfalls where blue-and-white skysnares hunt some freshwater fish (Nexus of Power, p. 119). A steep, rocky path behind the waterfall leads directly to the high ruins, where the raw power of the Force is felt most strongly (Nexus of Power, p. 120).<br /><br />Access to the ruins is blocked by heavy, large, and locked doors, which, once opened, lead to a large, empty chamber. Driven by the Force, winding, narrow stairs lead to an adjacent cylindrical tower. At the end of the stairs in the Cenote underground cave is a natural cavern the size of a freighter with stalactites on the ceiling. The central (NExus of Power, p. 80) Cenote chamber itself is  considered the most dangerous place in the ruins, reserved only for the most powerful Force users, as it subjected the user to a test of the Force. In the numerous other chambers, which could be reached by swimming through the river, one would enter smaller caves where shining bright lights like fireflies would generate visions (Nexus of Power, p. 121).<br /><br />According to a theory of the Jedi, once there was a Force user whose identity was forgotten, who was drawn to a world where they first discovered a place where the Force energy was highly concentrated. This area would later become known as the Acablas Convergence, and it was meant to be visited only by the strongest Force users (Nexus of Power, p. 49). The temple ruins were built by the first settlers, who were neither affiliated with the Sith nor the Jedi (Nexus of Power, p. 80). At the time of its discovery, the early settlers were drawn to Auratera to gain access to the Convergence. The population grew rapidly and reached a peak of up to five million inhabitants on Auratera (Nexus of Power, p. 49).<br /><br />Over the millennia, powerful Force users were repeatedly drawn to the world due to the raw Force energy, and as a result, the Acablas ruins changed hands many times. Therefore, the ruins were repeatedly part of the Galactic Republic as well as various Sith empires that expanded into the sector (Nexus of Power, p. 48). Both the Jedi Order and the Sith Order sent their highest-ranking members - Jedi Masters and Sith Lords - to Auratera over many eras. Buildings of both orders were erected and destroyed around the Convergence. Thus, there were ancient Jedi temple ruins as well as buildings of the Sith in the area, which were built on older foundations. In the eyes of many locals, however, the Convergence was just a curse that attracted aggressive Force users who sought to conquer the planet and devote themselves to the political interests of the dominant faction. Each subsequent war since then has caused more settlers to decide to move further away from the Convergence and ultimately abandon their lives on Auratera altogether (Nexus of Power, p. 49).</p>"
const crystalDesc = "<p>The CRYSTAL SEA is an inland sea located on the Outer Rim world of Auratera. Situated on the East coast of the sea in the Southern hemisphere of the world is a bay where the Ithorian city of Dewbright is located. Over the years, the native Ithorians used boats and skimmers to cross the sea.</p>"
const dewDesc = "<p>DEWBRIGHT is a city on the planet Auratera that is predominantly inhabited by Ithorians with a population of around 15,000 inhabitants. In keeping with Ithorian tradition, DEWBRIGHT is located on elevated platforms and situated in a bay on the east coast of the inland sea Crystal Sea. They could cross the water using boats and skimmers to reach the various dining establishments, which were located far from the city. The city was located in the southern hemisphere of Auratera, exactly opposite the locus of the Acablas ruins. (Nexus of Power, p. 48 & 50)</p>"
const erkeereDesc = "<p>The ERKEERE RIDGE is a mountain range on the Outer Rim world of Auratera. This range consists of a total of five mountains, with the largest peak, which is twice as high as the other four neighboring mountains, called Dran's Peak. The thin mountain range winds across Auratera's largest continent, forming a continuous line that extends from the North to the South Pole. The tall, jagged mountains resemble the teeth of a primitive bow saw and the mountain range can be seen from the convergence point at the Acablas Ruins. The city of Hriin was located on the other side of the mountain range. Some Skysnares have their nests there. Various Sith empires used the summit of the highest mountain in the mountain range as a ritualistic site for Sith magic.</p>"
const hriinDesc = "<p> HRIIN is the name of a settlement on the planet Auratera. During the era of the Empire, approximately 8,000 inhabitants still lived in the city. In terms of location, HRIIN was built over 3,000 kilometers from the Acablas ruins, a vergence of the Force. The city was also situated on the other side of the Erkeere Ridge, located on the high cliffs above the Hriin River, which provided the locals with a source of water, food, and transportation. HRIIN is mainly inhabited by representatives of the Twi'lek and Human species. Although HRIIN does not have any spaceports, there are smaller landing platforms for spacecraft and airspeeders. While basic maintenance and health systems exist, the energy supply proves particularly problematic due to the aging, water-powered generators, which are known to be particularly temperamental. The city itself is led by an elected chancellor. (Nexus of Power, p. 50) </p>";
const hriinriverDesc = "<p>The HRIIN RIVER is a body of water on the planet Auratera. It is located near the Erkeere Ridge and shares the same name as the settlement of Hriin. The Twi'lek and Human inhabitants of the city of Hriin primarily use the river as a source of water and food, as well as a means of transportation. The river's water also serves as a source of energy for the city, as the generators could convert the water into energy. However, the poor condition of the energy generators does not allow for a reliable power supply. The city itself is located on high cliffs above the river. (Nexus of Power, p. 50)</p>"
const senoloroDesc = "<p>SENOLORO is the largest city on the planet Auratera. By the time of the Empire era, the settlement is inhabited by 30,000 residents of the Duros and human species. SENOLORO is located on a large flatland island at the planet's equator, surrounded by six inland seas and their rivers. Many farms are established along the region. The city is located one-third of the way around the planet from the Acablas ruins. Senoloro has the most advanced spaceport on the planet, consisting of several hangars with old freighters that could travel to the rest of the galaxy.<br />The city is led by a human autocrat named a Gouverneur.</p>"
const squareDesc = "<p>On the world of Auratera, SQUARE SEA is the name of an artificial body of water with an area of 250,000 kmÂ².Visually, the lake is a square-shaped body of water, measuring approximately 500 kilometers on each side. Each side corresponds to a cardinal direction on a compass, and the lake is situated 800 kilometers west of the Acablas Ruins. The origins of the lake are largely unknown, although several legends suggested that it was constructed during the early Sith Wars. However, which of the two opposing sides was responsible for its construction remained a mystery. (Nexus of Power, p. 48 & 51)</p>";
const peakDesc = "<p>DRAN'S PEAK is the name of a mountain peak in the Erkeere Range of the Outer Rim world Auratera. It is the largest mountain in the range, being twice as tall as the four adjacent peaks. Throughout history, the world has been repeatedly conquered by Sith Empires, causing the world's vergence to shift towards the Dark Side. The Sith conducted their Sith magic rituals on the peak. The summit can be seen from the vergence itself, the Acablas Ruins.</p>";
const sithDesc = "<p>The former SITH PYRAMID would have been a stone temple of the Sith located at the Acablas Ruins on the world Auratera. Its structure would have been a recognizable pyramid shape with its entrance located on the right side of the crater's edge and extending halfway up the cone. At the edge of the temple, a ceremonial path would have lead away from the ruins to the once magnificent entrance lined with the remains of Sith statues. A long balcony would have protruded from the structure and extended high above the crater, although not directly over the opening of the crater. On this balcony, Sith alchemists would have conducted Sith rituals. (Nexus of Power, p. 81f.)</p>";
